# Andor's Trail Directory V2

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run localy

1. You need game sources (values, xml, drawable, raw) at "public" directry. I use "link.bat" to make Symbolic Link.
2. You need have NPM installed. You can get it at https://nodejs.org/en/download/. 
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'npm run gen' to render TMS to JPG for global map pages. Yes, it really takes a long time.
5. Run 'npm start' for starting local development server.
6. Run 'npm build' to generate production build.
7. To make route from any page to index.html I use "build.bat"
